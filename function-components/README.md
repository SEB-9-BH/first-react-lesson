## Function components

React components are essentially JavaScript functions that let you combine markup, CSS, and JavaScript into reusable UI elements.

We've already created the `App.jsx` function component, but let's take a step back and break down the process of creating a new component from scratch using `App` as our example. 

### Step 1: Define the function

The first step when creating a function component is to define the function. React function components are composed in exactly the same way as normal JavaScript functions: 

```jsx
const App = () => {

}
```

> ðŸ§  From the React Docs: 'React components are regular JavaScript functions, but their names must start with a capital letter or they won't work!'

### Step 2: Add markup

Next, we add the markup inside of the `return` statement of function. Here we have an `<h1>` element with the text content `Hello world!`.

```jsx
  return (
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
  );
```

> ðŸ§  Markup inside of the `return` statement is what will be displayed to the user.

Note that the markup we add goes inside of a `return`. It is also surrounded by `( )` because we've split what will be returned across multiple lines. Without the parenthesis, code on lines after the `return` would be ignored.

### Step 3: Export the function

React uses [ES Module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) syntax for importing and exporting files. `export default` allows us to denote a main function in a file to export, which can then be imported in other files. 

### Step 4: Importing/using the component

With the component exported we can now use it anywhere in our application. We're already importing and using it in the `src/main.jsx` file, let's check it out:

```jsx
// src/main.jsx

import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
// We import the default export from App.jsx. 
// We can name the function whatever we want here, so we'll call it 'App' 
import App from './App.jsx'
import './index.css'

// We use the component below. Note that the tag is self-closing.
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
)
```
